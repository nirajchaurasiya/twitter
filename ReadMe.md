# twitter

Welcome to my new project which is a twitter clone. Here, you can login, register, tweet, like, comment, delete your tweets etc.

link for the site is [https://twiittr.netlify.app](https://twiittr.netlify.app)

# Note:

- This app is not made for mobile devices or smaller screen less than 700px although you can view the website without any error but you will need to zoom a little.

- The backend is hosted on a free server so the problem related to backend like slow connection or slow fetching data can occur. So, please be patient.

- And last, because my frontend is hosted on netlify as you can see in domain itself, whenever the page reload to the same page automatically it shows link broken error. I don't know but the problem is with netlify, I guess, 'cause I have deployed many website made with nextjs but I don't know whenever I host react application it shows this error.
